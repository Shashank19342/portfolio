                    Hello there, my name's <b>Shashank Singh</b>. I am a <b>Third Year IT</b> student at <b>Army Institute 
                    of Technology Pune</b>. I have some good programming skills, which I have learned in my past 
                    few Year's of College. I have practiced my skills and sharpned them by working on different 
                    projects.
                </p><br/>
                <p>
                    I have seen many failures while working on these Projects and each time I have learned 
                    something new to counter such Problems.
                </p><br/>
                <p>
                    Failure has been a part of life and probebly will be a part of life weather one wants to or 
                    not, but learning from such failures and making sure not to repeat it makes the diffrence.
                </p><br/>
